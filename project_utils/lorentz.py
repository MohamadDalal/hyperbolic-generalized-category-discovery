"""
Implementation of common operations for the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry.
This model represents a hyperbolic space of `d` dimensions on the upper-half of
a two-sheeted hyperboloid in a Euclidean space of `(d+1)` dimensions.

Hyperbolic geometry has a direct connection to the study of special relativity
theory -- implementations in this module borrow some of its terminology. The axis
of symmetry of the Hyperboloid is called the _time dimension_, while all other
axes are collectively called _space dimensions_.

All functions implemented here only input/output the space components, while
while calculating the time component according to the Hyperboloid constraint:

    `x_time = torch.sqrt(1 / curv + torch.norm(x_space) ** 2)`
